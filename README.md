# FIRST Aid Robot Repository

This repository contains all of the files, instuctions, and other resources required to create your teams very own FIRST Aid robot for a family in need.

## What is FIRST Aid?
Through FIRST Aid, we aim to unite robotics innovation with children in need. Our program, initiated by the FTC Team [MegaKnytes 11093](https://github.com/MegaKnytes) in partnership with FIRST, harnesses the expertise and passion of FIRST robotics teams to design and build custom Simple Task Assist Robots (STARs) for children with mobility limitations. Our mission is clear: build a shared repository of free designs with fellow robotics teams across the globe and connect those teams and resources to the children who will benefit most from the greater independence these robots provide.

At the heart of our mission lies a passion for helping children with limited mobility, especially those battling Duchenne’s Muscular Dystrophy. It started when the MegaKnytes built simple robots for two boys, both of whom have Duchenne’s Muscular Dystrophy. Witnessing the immediate and profound impact on these children's lives, we recognized that many more children could benefit from similar assistance. FIRST, with its pool of skilled and enthusiastic robotics students, is uniquely positioned to help.

## What are S.T.A.R.s?
S.T.A.R.s, or Simple Task Assist Robots, are custom-designed to help kids with everyday tasks. S.T.A.R. Robots are designed to be compact and cost-effective, specially tailored to meet the needs of young users.

These robots excel at making daily tasks easier, including:
- Picking up items from the floor and repositioning objects to make them more accessible while sitting.
- Lifting small objects, such as a water bottle, to ensure they can be easily reached.
- Holding a cell phone or small device for visibility or usage
### What S.T.A.R.s are NOT:
- S.T.A.R. Robots are not classified as medical-grade robotics.
- S.T.A.R. Robots are not designed to improve user mobility.
- S.T.A.R. Robots are non-wearable and do not offer any form of movement assistance.
